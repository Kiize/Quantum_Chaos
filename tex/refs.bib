    abstract = {A simple expansion method for numerically calculating the energy levels and the corresponding wave functions of a quantum particle in a two-dimensional infinite potential well with arbitrary shape (quantum billiard) is presented. The method permits the study of quantum billiards in an introductory quantum mechanics course. According to the method, wave functions inside the billiard are expressed in terms of an expansion of a complete set of orthonormal functions defined in a surrounding rectangle for which the Dirichlet boundary conditions apply, while approximating the billiard boundary by a potential energy step of a sufficiently large size. Numerical implementations of the method are described and applied to determine the energies and wave functions for quarter-circle, circle, and triangle billiards. Finally, the expansion method is applied to investigate the quantum signatures of chaos in a classically chaotic generic-triangle billiard.},

abstract="The distinction between level clustering and level repulsion is one of the quantum analogues of the classical distinction between globally regular and predominantly chaotic motion (see Figs. 1, 2, 3). In order to reveal level repulsion under conditions of global classical chaos special care may be necessary: (i) subspectra referring to different values of the quantum numbers related to symmetries must be dealt with separately and (ii) for systems with quantum localization only levels whose wavefunctions have overlapping support must be admitted. A ``level'' may either be an energy eigenvalue E in the case of autonomous systems or, for periodically driven systems, a quasi-energy $\phi$, i.e. an eigenphase of the unitary Floquet operator transporting the wavevector from period to period.",
